sysinfo
======

Carbon was created for two reasons. First, I wanted to learn a bit about shell scripts. Second, I wanted a way to 
get feedback about the progress of ditto. 


Installing sysinfo
-----------------

From the command prompt, type:

     cp ./sysinfo /usr/local/bin/sysinfo
     chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sysinfo

Or to output to a file:
